                <p>The Kansas City Zoo & Aquarium is a sanctuary for all types of wildlife located in Kansas City, Missouri and recognized for its commitment to many different conservation programs. Since it opened in 1909, it has made a huge impact on conservation efforts around the world, including with the coral reefs in the Caribbean and the United States, and with partnerships that rescue animals such as sea otters. Additionally, the Kansas City Zoo & Aquarium works closely with its community, such as through providing curriculums for schools and offering special programs to help people make environmentally-conscious choices in their daily lives.</p>
