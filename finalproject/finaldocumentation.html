    <h1>Project Documentation</h1>
    <h4>May 27, 2025</h4>
    <p>This week I took time to work on the framework / outline of my project, looked into gathering information from APIs, and researched how to take that information and put it into specific places. So far, the outline is nearly complete, I just need to tweak my css a bit more to make it come out the way I want it to. Since the outline is still a work in progress, I have not gotten to the point of integrating data yet, but I did get access to an API key. This was an initial concern I had during my proposal, but I took into consideration the TMDB recommendation and found that they have a very accessible and user-friendly API. I have yet to run into any issues, but I am gearing up for the possibility with the next steps of my project, since that will be more heavily focused on coding and integrating data. I have been doing research on the best steps to take to sync information to specific places within my outline. Iâ€™m happy with my progress so far and am excited to get to the next steps, as this will be the main bulk of my project.</p>

    <p>The outline is now complete and I have most of the data figured out for integration. Thankfully, I did not run into any major issues while doing this and the research I put in paid off in terms of getting everything to align. After receiving feedback, I am going to stick with the color scheme I originally chose. Aesthetically, I like the simplicity of it because it's not too distracting and the objective of the game is clear. I do want to incorporate a few extra details to make it all come together.</p>
    <h4>June 12, 2025</h4>
    <p>In the past week, I've finetuned a few details and added an entry page, which I think really makes it feel like a cohesive game. I also added to the winner/loser screens to have popup gifs and sound effects. After watching a tutorial on something simple about cleaning up my API usage, I was informed that it is not in good practice to have a private API key sit on the frontend, so I spent quite some time, with the help of many tutorials, to create a backend server through render to mask the API and run through their free service. It was a lot of work and took a long time to get everything working since I had to reconfigure my script that was originally in my index.html into its own server.js. I'm very happy with the result though and feel good about the way my project looks and functions.</p>
