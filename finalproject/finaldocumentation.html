    <h4>May 27, 2025</h4>
    <p>This week I took time to work on the framework / outline of my project, looked into gathering information from APIs, and researched how to take that information and put it into specific places. So far, the outline is nearly complete, I just need to tweak my css a bit more to make it come out the way I want it to. Since the outline is still a work in progress, I have not gotten to the point of integrating data yet, but I did get access to an API key. This was an initial concern I had during my proposal, but I took into consideration the TMDB recommendation and found that they have a very accessible and user-friendly API. I have yet to run into any issues, but I am gearing up for the possibility with the next steps of my project, since that will be more heavily focused on coding and integrating data. I have been doing research on the best steps to take to sync information to specific places within my outline. Iâ€™m happy with my progress so far and am excited to get to the next steps, as this will be the main bulk of my project.</p>
