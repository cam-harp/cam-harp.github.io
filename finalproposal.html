<h1>"Rated"</h1>
<body>
    I am making a NYT Games inspired daily movie rating game called Rated (work in progress name). <br>
    It will be presented to the class via a website I create with html/css & js. I may experiment with frameworking and possibly creating a basic app for it.
<p> 
    Steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Create the website's outline and prepare for data input (approx. 1-2 days)</li>
        <li>Integrate data from movie rating database (up to a week (I hope not))</li>
        <li>Using information gathered from the database, configure system to cross-reference user inputs to determine success or failure and for the system to use that info to respond accordingly (possibly another week)</li>
        <li>Use css to design website to enhance user experience (approx. 2-3 days)</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    To complete these steps, I will need to learn how to integrate the API and cross-reference data gathered to compare with the user input. I will also need some more in-depth learning on css. I know there is more that I will find out along the way and I am excited to learn.
</p>
 <p>
   The tools I'll be using are html, javascript, and css, plus whatever it takes to integrate APIs into my work. 
 </p>    
 <p>
    I will be doing something of a 'type-written' diary compiling tutorials and references I use as well as notes about my progress and things that I've completed and what I still need to work on.
 </p>
<p>
    This project is about using movie database information to create a game where people can try to guess the rating of each movie. <br>
    If they guess correctly, there will be a celebratory animation. If they guess incorrectly, they get 5 chances total and each turn will tell them higher/lower. If they fail after 5 guesses, they will get a disappointed animation instead. <br>
    It will be designed to be replayable daily with a random, new movie each day, similar to NYT Games like Wordle and Connections.
